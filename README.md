# Random Map Generators

The repo contains several random map generators within in several Jupyter notebooks. Each notebooks contains a specific implementation of the Perlin noise algorithm.  Where possible for me, I have tweaked the implementation with Cython in order to make the scripts run faster. 

## Dependencies

### Python

In order to run the scripts, you will need to install the following libraries:

* `cython`
* `numpy`
* `PIL`
* `jupyter`

All other libraries used should be contained in the standard library of `Python 3`.

## Pregenerated Maps

A collection of pregenerated maps in `PNG`-format may be found in the `2D_maps_blank/png`.
